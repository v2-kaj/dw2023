**Assignment: Housing Market Website**

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts of sessions and cookies by developing an online housing market where property owners can list their properties for rent. This assignment will also test your understanding of user authentication, secure data handling, and user interface design.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a user authentication system using email addresses and secure password hashing.
   - Users should be able to log in with their email addresses and passwords as their credentials.
   - Implement a registration system for new users, collecting their email address, first name, last name, and password.
   - Ensure that duplicate email addresses are not allowed during registration.
   
2. **Property Listing:**
   - Authenticated users (logged in) should have the ability to list their properties for rent.
   - Property details should include information such as price, location, images, owner, and a description.
   - Users who are not logged in should only be able to view listed properties but not list their own properties.
   - OPTIONAL: Property owners should be able to update property details or delete their listed properties.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Utilize prepared statements for all interactions with the database to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Securely hash user passwords using any established encryption methods.
   
4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Design a user-friendly interface for all web pages using HTML and CSS.
   - Ensure that the website's design is mobile responsive to provide a seamless experience across different devices.

**Note:**
Feel free to use the code given during classes to guide your implementation. However, make the website your own by implementing your own designs and styles. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to seek assistance.

**Happy Hacking!!**
